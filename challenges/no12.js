// To flatten the list, you can use a depth-first traversal of the list, recursively visiting each sublist and adding the values to the output array.

// This function uses a helper function traverse which takes in the current node and adds its value to the output array. It then checks if the current node has a sublist and if so, it recursively calls traverse on that sublist. After visiting the sublist, it also checks if the current node has a next value and if so, it recursively calls traverse on that next value.
